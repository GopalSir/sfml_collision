# sfml_collision
A sfml program to simulate 2D collision in C++
(Tested on Ubuntu)

Make sure your compiler can find the SFML Include files on your system ( after installing them ) and both compile time linker and run time linker can find the shared libraries ( It is supposed to be the same location for both)
